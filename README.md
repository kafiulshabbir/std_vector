# std_vector

This is a shame to humanity. This reprository is not deleted to remind me that in 2020, I thought I will be able to write a std::vector library with my own hands, and it was a miserable failure, JUST USE STD::VECTOT, DO NOT NEED TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS. Also, this is a good memeory, now I am old and much less intellectually capable than I was in 2020, I shall never be able to even experience the process of writing a vector with my own hands.
